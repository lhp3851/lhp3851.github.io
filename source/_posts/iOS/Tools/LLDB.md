  display   -- Evaluate an expression at every stop (see 'help target stop-hook'.)
  down      -- Select a newer stack frame.  Defaults to moving one frame, a numeric argument can specify an arbitrary number.
  env       -- Shorthand for viewing and setting environment variables.
  exit      -- Quit the LLDB debugger.
  f         -- Select the current stack frame by index from within the current thread (see 'thread backtrace'.)
  file      -- Create a target using the argument as the main executable.
  finish    -- Finish executing the current stack frame and stop after returning.  Defaults to current thread unless specified.
  image     -- Commands for accessing information for one or more target modules.
  j         -- Set the program counter to a new address.
  jump      -- Set the program counter to a new address.
  kill      -- Terminate the current target process.
  l         -- List relevant source code using one of several shorthand formats.
  list      -- List relevant source code using one of several shorthand formats.
  n         -- Source level single step, stepping over calls.  Defaults to current thread unless specified.
  next      -- Source level single step, stepping over calls.  Defaults to current thread unless specified.
  nexti     -- Instruction level single step, stepping over calls.  Defaults to current thread unless specified.
  ni        -- Instruction level single step, stepping over calls.  Defaults to current thread unless specified.
  p         -- Evaluate an expression on the current thread.  Displays any returned value with LLDB's default formatting.
  parray    -- Evaluate an expression on the current thread.  Displays any returned value with LLDB's default formatting.
  po        -- Evaluate an expression on the current thread.  Displays any returned value with formatting controlled by the type's author.
  poarray   -- Evaluate an expression on the current thread.  Displays any returned value with LLDB's default formatting.
  print     -- Evaluate an expression on the current thread.  Displays any returned value with LLDB's default formatting.
  q         -- Quit the LLDB debugger.
  r         -- Launch the executable in the debugger.
  rbreak    -- Sets a breakpoint or set of breakpoints in the executable.
  repl      -- Evaluate an expression on the current thread.  Displays any returned value with LLDB's default formatting.
  run       -- Launch the executable in the debugger.
  s         -- Source level single step, stepping into calls.  Defaults to current thread unless specified.
  si        -- Instruction level single step, stepping into calls.  Defaults to current thread unless specified.
  sif       -- Step through the current block, stopping if you step directly into a function whose name matches the TargetFunctionName.
  step      -- Source level single step, stepping into calls.  Defaults to current thread unless specified.
  stepi     -- Instruction level single step, stepping into calls.  Defaults to current thread unless specified.
  t         -- Change the currently selected thread.
  tbreak    -- Set a one-shot breakpoint using one of several shorthand formats.
  undisplay -- Stop displaying expression at every stop (specified by stop-hook index.)
  up        -- Select an older stack frame.  Defaults to moving one frame, a numeric argument can specify an arbitrary number.
  v         -- Show variables for the current stack frame. Defaults to all arguments and local variables in scope. Names of argument, local, file static and file global variables can be specified. Children of aggregate variables can be specified such as
               'var->child.x'.  The -> and [] operators in 'frame variable' do not invoke operator overloads if they exist, but directly access the specified element.  If you want to trigger operator overloads use the expression command to print the variable
               instead.
               It is worth noting that except for overloaded operators, when printing local variables 'expr local_var' and 'frame var local_var' produce the same results.  However, 'frame variable' is more efficient, since it uses debug information and memory
               reads directly, rather than parsing and evaluating an expression, which may even involve JITing and running code in the target program.
  var       -- Show variables for the current stack frame. Defaults to all arguments and local variables in scope. Names of argument, local, file static and file global variables can be specified. Children of aggregate variables can be specified such as
               'var->child.x'.  The -> and [] operators in 'frame variable' do not invoke operator overloads if they exist, but directly access the specified element.  If you want to trigger operator overloads use the expression command to print the variable

  vo        -- Show variables for the current stack frame. Defaults to all arguments and local variables in scope. Names of argument, local, file static and file global variables can be specified. Children of aggregate variables can be specified such as

  x         -- Read from the memory of the current target process.
